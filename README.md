## OpenIPC Install ##    

#### June 8th, 2018 ####

#### Version 0.2.6.1

#### https://openip.cam ####


### Full Disclosure ###

    - OpenIPC for Wyze V2 is forked from dafang-hacks and is based on a proprietary Wyze firmware (demo.bin) with implementations allowing the end user to take full control of their Wyze camera.
    - OpenIPC for Wyze V1 is forked from fang-hacks and is based on a proprietary Xiaomi firmware (FIRMWARE_660R.bin) with implementations allowing the end user to take full control of their Wyze camera.
    - At this time OpenIPC is not a 100% completely open source project as we rely upon the chinese base firmware at the moment to execute our payload (install method).
    - We do not have intentions to rewrite low level boot code and drivers for this camera model, instead we provide end users the ability to mitigate risk by gaining full root control.
    - Source code repositories for all added binaries will be added to the project shortly (snx_rtsp_server/dropbear). The inherent risk of a chinese base firmware can now be fully mitigated.

### Installation Instructions Wyze V2: ###

This process only works for Wyze V2. There are no flashing LED or sound effects from V1.

1. Download this git repository.

2. Copy the contents of firmware_mod/v2/ to the root of your sdcard.

3. Set up Wifi in the SD card config folder. Rename wpa_supplicant.conf.dist to wpa_supplicant.conf, then update the ssid and psk values.

4. Power off your camera, insert the SD card

5. Hold the setup button, plug in your USB cable, keep holding the setup button for 3-6 seconds

6. Once the light is solid blue, release the button and wait for 3-4 minutes. The camera will reboot and change light status during this time.

7. The camera will appear on your network with a mac address similar to this: C8:02:8F:10:03:FA

8. To access the web interface, visit the camera's IP address in your browser (http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx). Username: dafang Password: ismart12

9. RTSP stream (when enabled), rtsp://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8554/unicast


### Known Issues: ###
    - Auto Night Mode does not work due to Wyze V2 missing LDR chip
    - Full 1080p not supported. 1600x900 is maximum resolution.

### Installation Instructions Wyze V1: ###


1. Download and install [Etcher](https://etcher.io) or [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)

2. Write the openipc_v0.2.4.img to your SDcard

3. Open the SDCard and edit the files .wifissid and .wifipasswd to match your network

4. Flash the firmware to the camera:


    - Hold down the setup button for 10 seconds BEFORE connecting power
    - With button still depressed, plug in power to the camera while continuing to hold for another 10 - 12 seconds.
    - Release the button when the connection light blinks continually.
    - Press the button again and you should hear a Chinese voice prompt if successful.


5. Remove SDcard and reboot camera and reinsert after boot until you hear "click click".

6. Repeat Step 5 until you hear "click click".

7. Run openipscan.sh or openipscanwin.sh if you're on windows/mac and find the IP address of your new OpenIP Camera. Note: MAC address will be changed to c0:6d:1a*

8. Proceed to the status web page and apply the hacks. http://[discoveredipaddress]/cgi-bin/status 

NOTE: of you get a 404 error with a flashing blue led, Remove the sdcard and reinsert it. Shortly after thst the camera will go "click click" again. Proceed to the link now



Congratulations! Welcome to OpenIPC.
